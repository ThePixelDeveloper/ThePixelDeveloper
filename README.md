# Hello there,

I'm Mathew - and _yes_, it's just one 't', not two. Currently, I'm steering the ship as a Technical Manager at Just Eat Takeaway.

My professional journey took flight in the realm of software engineering, where I sharpened my skills in several programming languages, including JavaScript, PHP, and GoLang. Not content with that, I ventured into the specialized fields of PCB design and embedded programming, wielding the power of low-level C with Microchip Studio as my tool of choice ðŸ§°.

Beyond the world of coding, I dabble in the less binary side of software engineering ðŸŽ­. I've dipped my toes into internal conferences, distributed essential information, and even seized the mic at meet-ups from time to time ðŸŽ¤.

I may not have a treasure trove of projects to showcase, but don't be fooled - I'm no stranger to the open-source community. From supporting the no-code editor, baklava, with a few well-placed financial boosts ðŸ’µ, to submitting code tweaks to libreddit, the privacy-centric Reddit front-end, I do my bit.

And of course, in this rapidly evolving tech universe, I'm always on the lookout for the next big thing. Right now, I've got my eye on emerging technologies like LLMs ðŸŒ . So here's to the future - may it be as unpredictable and exciting as a JavaScript update! ðŸ¥‚
