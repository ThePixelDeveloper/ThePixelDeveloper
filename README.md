Hey,

I'm Mathew (just one 't', please) 😁. I'm a Technical Manager at Just Eat Takeaway.

My professional journey started with software engineering, honing my skills in JavaScript, PHP, and GoLang 💻. I also dove into PCB design and embedded programming, using low-level C to create LED bike displays (I have videos!).

Beyond just coding, I'm involved in all aspects of software engineering 🎭. From internal conferences to spreading key updates, to the occasional meet-up speaking gig 🎤.

Don't be fooled by my sparse project portfolio; I'm an active open-source community contributor. I've financially supported the baklava no-code editor 💵 and tweaked the code for libreddit, a privacy-focused Reddit front-end.

In our fast-paced tech world, I keep an eye on emerging trends, particularly LLMs 🌠. Here's to a future as thrilling as a JavaScript update! 🥂

Lastly, feel free to reach out to me for workshops, or speaker opportunities. I'm always open to collaboration and sharing knowledge. Let's connect and create something impactful together!
